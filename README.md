### Our program is a simple Poker program allowing players to play 5 Card Draw
Simply click start and follow the game instructions and enter a name if you wish,
or play using the default player name *Player 1* 

From there, you will play rounds of poker against the computer AI. Each round consist of a betting period(s),
a limited period allowing for swapping cards to get a better hand, and a showdown phase to see who won that round.
The winner is decided when one person runs out of money or can't afford to buy into any more rounds of play.
